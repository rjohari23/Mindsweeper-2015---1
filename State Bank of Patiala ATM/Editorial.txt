Method A - Use of set First add all PINs to a set A. Then for each of the PINs, remove the digits one by one from the end and check if the remainder
is in A. The standard libraries typically provide efficient enough set structures based on either hashing or a balanced tree.


Method B - Sorting First sort the PINs lexicographically. Then check each PIN if it is a prefix of the next PIN in the list.
