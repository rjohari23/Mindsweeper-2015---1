Observe that the definition of non-decreasing averages can be applied to any sequence. If we remove the condition that 
sequence s1,...,sn+1 is non-decreasing but fixing a single si fixes the entire sequence, given its average sequence 
p1,p2,...,pn. 
Now let us define the reflection(mirror) operation 'R' on integer 'A' with respect to center 'C' as follows: 
R(A,C) = B iff 1/2(A+B) = C ,i.e., R(A,C) = 2C-A. If si is fixed, then si+1 = R(si,pi) and si-1 = R(si,pi-1), etc. 
Hence, there exist an infinite number of sequences s1,...,sn+1 that have the given sequence p1,p2,...,pn as 
average sequence â€” one for each choice of s1.

There is a finite number of non-decreasing sequences though. A simple upper bound on the number of possible non-decreasing 
sequences may be p2 - p1 + 1, which is the number of integers between p1 and p2 (inclusive). 
This is because s2 must satisfy p1 <= s2 <= p2. Indeed, if s2 < p1 then s1 > p2 and therefore s2 < s1 so the sequence 
is not non-decreasing. Similarly, if s2 > p2 then s3 < p2 giving a sequence which is not non-decreasing either.

This way we can construct a solution, which tests all the possible values of s2 lying between p1 and p2, and for each such s2 
it computes the rest of the sequence and then checks if it is non-decreasing. 
Such a solution works in Time complexity = O(n(p2 - p1 + 1)) and can be implemented with O(n) or 
better O(p2 - p1 +1) memory complexity.


Optimal solution:


Read this first : 
a value 'V' feasible for si in the given sequence, when there exists an nondecreasing sequence s1,...,sn+1 with si = V 
and average sequence p1,p2,...,pn. 
Now an important observation. If for some i values A and B with A <= B are feasible for si, then every C in the interval [A,B] 
is feasible for si.

The actual number of nondecreasing sequences s1,...,sn+1 can be obtained by generalizing the problem as follows. 

Given a nondecreasing sequence p1,p2,...,pn, determine the interval of feasible values for sn+1. The answer is then 
the size of that interval. In the model solution the interval of feasible values of sn+1 is computed by induction. 
We start with the case n = 0. In this case, the interval of feasible values for s1 consists of all integers: (-inf,+inf). 
Now let [a,b] be the interval for nondecreasing sequences s1,...,sn+1 having average sequence p1,p2,...,pn. 
Let us consider the average sequence p1,p2,...,pn extended by a new element pn+1 > pn(non-decreasing according to problem statement).
This reduces the possible values for sn+1 to the interval [a,min(b,pn+1)] and hence the interval for sn+2 is the reflection
of this interval, i.e, [r(min(b,pn+1),pn+1),r(a,pn+1)]. We consider interval [a,b] as empty if a > b(conflicting with problem statement),
and otherwise it contains b - a + 1 elements. This way we obtain O(n) time complexity and O(1) memory complexity solution, 
because there is no need to store the entire sequence in memory as intervals of feasible values can be computed during input.
