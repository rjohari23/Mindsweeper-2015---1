If you read the problem statement you will find a pattern how rabbits and bunnies are increasing each day.

On day 1 - 1 Pair
On day 2 - 1 Pair
On day 3 - 2 Pair
On day 4 - 3 Pair

and so on..

if you write this sequence as 1,1,2,3,...N. You will notice that this a Fibonacci Sequence where next term is sum of the previous two terms.
F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2]
Now the problem statement says output the numbers of rabbit and bunnies pairs on the Nth day. So you just have to print the Nth term of the fibonacci sequence.

Note: The output can be very large therefore you need to print it modulo 10^9+7.

Complexity : O(Log(n))
